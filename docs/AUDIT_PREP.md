> **Document status:** Pre-audit draft — complete all `<TO BE FILLED>` placeholders before handing to the audit firm.

## 1. Audit Scope

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pinned commit** | `2eba4f3321fde31a4af33934f2fa444a20fb202a` |

### In scope

- All Rust source files under `neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/`

- `contract-spec.json` (canonical function ABI at repo root)

### Out of scope

## 2. Artifact Hashes

### Compiled WASM

The optimised WASM binary is produced by the **Build WASM** job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and uploaded as the GitHub Actions artifact **`neurowealth-vault-wasm`** (14-day retention).

| Artifact | SHA-256 |
| :--- | :--- |
| `neurowealth_vault.wasm` | `<TO BE FILLED: run CI on pinned commit and record SHA-256 of neurowealth_vault.wasm>` |

To compute the hash yourself after building:

```bash
sha256sum neurowealth_vault.wasm
```

To build locally and reproduce:

```bash
cd neurowealth-vault
stellar contract build
sha256sum target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/neurowealth_vault.wasm
```

### Function ABI

`contract-spec.json` at the repository root is the canonical function ABI, generated from the WASM on every CI run. Auditors should verify that the spec matches the source under review.

## 3. Architecture Overview

NeuroWealth Vault is an **ERC-4626-inspired yield vault** implemented as a Soroban smart contract on the Stellar blockchain.

### Core design

- **Share-based accounting.** Depositors receive vault shares. The exchange rate is derived from `TotalAssets / TotalShares`, so yield accrued by the AI agent is automatically reflected in each user's redemption value.
- **Three roles.** `Owner` (administrator), `Agent` (AI rebalancer), and `User` (depositor/withdrawer). Full trust-model analysis: [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).
- **Two yield protocols.** Blend Protocol (lending) and the Stellar native DEX (liquidity provision). The active protocol is tracked in contract state; only the Agent may trigger transitions via `rebalance()`.
- **Timelocked upgrades and agent rotation.** Both the WASM upgrade path and agent key rotation require a 24-hour timelock (`UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS = AGENT_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS = 17,280 ledgers`).
- **Emergency pause.** The Owner may pause all state-changing operations at any time.
- **Strict CEI pattern.** All state mutations occur before external calls to prevent reentrancy.
- **Checked arithmetic.** All integer operations use Rust's checked/saturating variants; bare arithmetic operators are rejected by CI lint.

## 4. Known Issues & Accepted Risks

The following issues have been identified, assessed, and deliberately accepted by the development team. They are disclosed here in full for auditor awareness.

| ID | Title | Severity | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| KI-01 | Agent key is a single EOA on mainnet | HIGH | Accepted — mitigation: 24 h timelock on rotation | Multi-sig agent is planned for post-audit |
| KI-02 | Owner key is a single EOA on mainnet | HIGH | Accepted — mitigation: 24 h upgrade + agent timelock, two-step ownership transfer | Multi-sig owner recommended before mainnet |
| KI-03 | Blend/DEX pool addresses are owner-configurable | MEDIUM | Accepted — owner can point vault at a malicious pool | Runbook in `SECURITY.md`; pool changes emit `DexPoolConfiguredEvent` |
| KI-04 | Soroban persistent entry TTL expiry for dormant users | LOW | Accepted — `touch_user_ttl()` is permissionless; off-chain indexers expected to maintain TTLs | No fund loss; user can restore entry |
| KI-05 | `update_total_assets` bounded loss (10% per call) may not cover large protocol losses | MEDIUM | Accepted — agent is trusted; circuit-breaker caps single-call decrease | Monitoring required |
| KI-06 | Partial withdrawals during Blend high-utilization | LOW | Accepted — user retains shares; can retry | Documented in `docs/PARTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_BEHAVIOR.md` |
| KI-07 | `DataKey::Balance` deprecated key retained in enum | INFO | Accepted — no read/write path active; retained for serialization stability | Auditors: this key is inert |

## 5. Security Controls Summary

### Reentrancy

The **Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI)** pattern is enforced throughout the contract — all state writes complete before any external cross-contract call is made. Reentrancy protection tests: [`neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_legacy_inline.rs`](../neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/tests/test_legacy_inline.rs).

### Integer arithmetic

Checked arithmetic is used on every integer operation. Bare arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are prohibited in contract source and rejected by `cargo clippy` with `clippy::integer_arithmetic`. This is enforced on every CI run.

### Panic-free contract source

No bare `panic!()` calls are permitted in contract source. Enforced by [`scripts/check-no-bare-panic.sh`](../scripts/check-no-bare-panic.sh) on every CI run.

### Access control

Every public function's authentication requirements are verified against `contract-spec.json` on every CI run via `scripts/check-access-control.sh`. A second gate (`scripts/check-pub-fn-auth.sh`, Issue #611) ensures that any new state-changing public function is explicitly classified before it can be merged.

### Emergency pause

The Owner may call `pause()` at any time to halt all state-changing operations. The pause state is checked at the entry point of every mutating function.

### Upgrade and agent rotation safety

Both WASM upgrades and agent key rotations go through a two-step timelocked flow requiring 17,280 ledgers (~24 hours) between proposal and execution. Cancellation is available to the Owner at any time during the timelock window.

### Ownership transfer

Ownership transfer is a two-step flow (`transfer_ownership` + `accept_ownership`) to prevent accidental or malicious ownership loss.

## 6. Fuzz / Property-Test Inventory

All fuzz targets live under `neurowealth-vault/fuzz/fuzz_targets/` and are executed in CI.

**CI bounds:**
- PR (triggered when `vault/src/**` changes): `-runs=1000 -max_total_time=120`
- Weekly scheduled run: `-runs=5000 -max_total_time=300`

| Target | File | What it checks | CI trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `deposit_withdraw_sequence` | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/deposit_withdraw_sequence.rs` | Multi-user deposit/withdraw sequences; no invariant violation | PR + weekly |
| `share_accounting_invariants` | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/share_accounting_invariants.rs` | I-1 through I-6 from invariant register (sum shares, proportionality, total_assets ≥ total_deposits, exchange_rate ≥ 1.0) | PR + weekly |
| `rounding_boundaries` | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/rounding_boundaries.rs` | Floor-mint / ceil-burn rounding rules; vault never loses value | PR + weekly |
| `rebalance_transitions` | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/rebalance_transitions.rs` | Protocol state machine transitions (blend ↔ dex ↔ none); no stuck state | PR + weekly |
| `agent_update_timelock` | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/agent_update_timelock.rs` | Agent rotation timelock; can't confirm before expiry | PR + weekly |
| `admin_timelock_interleaved` | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/admin_timelock_interleaved.rs` | Interleaved upgrade + agent timelocks; no state corruption | PR + weekly |
| `user_strategy` | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/user_strategy.rs` | Strategy preference set/get; no cross-user contamination | PR + weekly |
| `upgrade_timelock` | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/upgrade_timelock.rs` | WASM upgrade timelock; can't execute before expiry | PR + weekly |

## 8. Self-Audit / Prior Review Results

### Internal security review

An internal blast-radius analysis has been completed. Results are documented in:

- `test/OwnerCompromiseBlastRadius.test.ts` — enumerates all actions available to a compromised owner key and their impact
- `test/NotOwnerCompromiseBlastRadius.test.ts` — enumerates all actions available to non-owner addresses and confirms they cannot exceed their intended permissions

### Third-party audit history

No prior third-party audit has been performed on this codebase. This engagement is the **first external security review**.

### Known test pass status

All 54 test modules pass on the pinned commit `2eba4f3321fde31a4af33934f2fa444a20fb202a`.
